1.) **What the project does**

--------------------------------------------------

Contains a Web Application build with **FLASK (Python Microframework, [Flask Docu](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/))**.
I originally started the project for learning purposes in my foundation sememester of Software Engineering. :shipit:
It is an Application to administrate Contacts and Inventory and I am looking to take it even further! At the moment it contains three     main pages. The Home-, Contacts- and the Inventory Page. On the home page I am looking to build a little overview, the rest should be     straight forward. 


1.1) Technologies used:

- Backend:
  - Python
  - Flask (+ WTForms for dynamiclly creating HTML Forms) 
  - MySQL (SQLAlchemy Flask Module -> ORM)

- Frontend:
  - Javascript
  - HTML -> Jinja2 (Standard Template Engine Flask)
  - CSS 
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
  2.) **Why the project is useful (for you and me)**
  
 --------------------------------------------------

 - From a developer site it is an fairly easy project to get started with Flask. 
 - From a User site its made to be as simple as possible 
 - It is free!?
 - Is looking to support or to be used by Organizations with Inventory and Contacts (every Organization? LOL)
  --------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 3.) **How you can get started with the project**
 
 --------------------------------------------------

- **Install Process**
  - Follow this 3 minute Installing Process: (Flask Docu, [Install Guide](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/))
  - Now you shiould have an Virtual Env. and Flask installed
  - Next download the repository and paste it in the new folder you created in the Tutorial
  - now go into the newly created directory in your console 
  - type: "$ export FLASK_APP=flaskapp" , to start in Dev. Mode on top type: "$ export FLASK_ENV=development"
  - Afterwards the Server starts and you can access the application under localhost:5000(http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
